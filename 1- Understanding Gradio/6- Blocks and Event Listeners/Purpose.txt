1. Blocks Class Defines the structure for a Gradio app, grouping components and logic in a flexible way.
   - Purpose Organizes components and interactions for building complex UIUX flows in Gradio demos.

2. click() event listener Triggers a function when a component, like a button, is clicked.
   - Purpose Defines interaction by binding user actions (e.g., clicks) to specific functions.

3. change() event listener Executes a function when a component, like a textbox, detects a change (e.g., typing).
   - Purpose Handles dynamic data changes and triggers functions without requiring button clicks.

4. Event listener decorator Attaches an event listener to a component using a decorator instead of function arguments.
   - Purpose Simplifies the syntax by embedding the event listener directly into the function definition.

5. submit() event listener Runs a function when an input, like a textbox, is submitted (e.g., pressing Enter).
   - Purpose Handles form submissions and other input actions conveniently.

6. Function Input List Accepts multiple inputs as a list, where each list item maps to a function argument.
   - Purpose Allows multiple inputs to be passed to a function sequentially.

7. Function Input Dict Passes multiple inputs as a dictionary, where each key corresponds to an input component.
   - Purpose Enables more flexibility and clarity when managing many input components.

8. Function Return List Returns multiple output values as a list, corresponding to each output component in order.
   - Purpose Supports updating multiple components at once by returning ordered values.

9. Function Return Dict Returns output values in a dictionary, mapping components to their updated values.
   - Purpose Allows selective updating of components based on conditional logic.

10. then() event chaining Runs a secondary event after a primary event has completed execution.
    - Purpose Enables step-by-step, sequential updating of components in multi-step workflows.

11. success() event listener Triggers a subsequent event only if the primary event runs successfully.
    - Purpose Ensures that the next event runs only if no errors occurred in the previous event.

12. on() event binding Binds multiple event triggers (e.g., click, submit) to the same function.
    - Purpose Offers flexible interaction by allowing multiple user actions to trigger a single function.
