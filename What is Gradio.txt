Gradio is an open-source Python library that allows you to quickly create user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models, APIs, or any Python function. It simplifies the process of sharing models or functions with others by providing an interactive and customizable interface.

Key features of Gradio:
- **Ease of Use**: You can create an interactive demo for your model or function in just a few lines of code.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Users can interact with your model directly through the browser, uploading files, entering text, or even speaking into a microphone, depending on the input/output components you define.
- Sharing: Gradio provides a sharable link to your interface, so you can deploy your models or applications for others to test or use, even if they don't have the underlying code.
